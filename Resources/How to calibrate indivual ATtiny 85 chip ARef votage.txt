1. Load "Software_Serial_Attiny_85_Aref_readprint" ino onto ATtiny 85.
2. Load "Arduino_uno_read_Aref_and_print" ino onto a Adruino Uno.  
3. Connect ATtny 85 Vcc GND Chip pin 3 TX to Arduino Uno ARef pin plus GND.
4. Start Arduino Uno "Arduino_uno_read_Aref_and_print" and open "serial  monitor".
   This will now print out Vcc read from the ATtinhy 85 and sent via soft serial to
   The Arduino Uno.In an ideal world this would be the same as what you would measure
   on pin 3 and GND  on the ATtiny 85 with a multi meter ,however due to slight differences
   in each ATtiny 85 Ref voltage they are not always 1.1v .
5. Calculate internal1.1Ref = 1.1 * Vcc1 (per voltmeter) / Vcc2 (per readVcc() function)
   Example ,mine was 4.96 v measured with multi meter therefore ,
   1.1 * 5.03/4.96 (5.03v output from serial monitor) ,= 1.155241 v.
   So this particular ATTiny 85 internal Ref is only 1.155241 v instead of 1.1 v.
6. Now find scale_constant internal 1.155241 * 1023 * 1000 = 1141181 .
7. Now put 1141181 into the "ATtiny 85 secret voltage reading" code ,this will now
   compensate for the lower reading of ARef v .
8. This is the is the part of the code to change "result = 1125300L / result;"
   becomes ""result = 1141181L / result;"
   code below is when ARef is 1.1v..........
  " result = 1125300L / result; // Calculate Vcc (in mV); 1125300 = 1.1*1023*1000
   return result; // Vcc in millivolts result = 1141181L / result; // Calculate Vcc (in mV); 1125300 = 1.1*1023*1000"
   return result; // Vcc in millivolts

scale_constant = internal1.1Ref * 1023 * 1000

where

internal1.1Ref = 1.1 * Vcc1 (per voltmeter) / Vcc2 (per readVcc() function)

Update 4 4 20 this just not work for Aref constant difference even when I set Vcc to 4.2v then calcultaed the constant to take into account
the difference in each chips Aref value 1.1v (ideal) but can be out by 10% better adjusting for main voltage you want use as a notification?
or a charge termination point and alter the code to what the multi meter reads and leave the costant as default.
this feature is far better used as a rough guide to say a battery level and not for a critical task................
